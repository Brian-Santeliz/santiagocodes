# Maria del Carmen Santiago Betancourt - aka [santiagocodes](https://santiagocodes.com/)

Hi there :wave: I am a web developer. You can usually find me working on front end projects, but I occasionally delve into back end (just to keep things interesting :wink:).

## My Values

:coffee: Coffee is a healthy addiction. <br />
:books: There is always something new to learn. <br />
:musical_note: Music can do wonders for the soul. <br />
:ear: Communication is key. Hear people out. <br />
:earth_africa: Explore and take care of our precious planets. <br />
:roller_coaster: Life is a roller coster. Enjoy the ride!

## How I Work

When working within a team I find that organizing a set of priorities and having a timeline is one of the best ways to work. I'm an easy person to be around with and will adapt to the situation/work environment with ease. Just talk to me.
